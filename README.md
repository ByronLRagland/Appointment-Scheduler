# Appointment Scheduler
###

## Description

The Appointment Scheduler application is a customizable platform that allows a business to implement a scheduling service for their establishment. Establishment owners can add services and time slots as selections for customers. Customers can book services at specified times. An employee makes empty appointments, with no client, no service, start time and end time. Those appointments are made available for customers to see. Customers may choose to add service to a particular appointment and complete that appointment. This project utilizes Java, Spring Framework, MySQL, React, Bootstrap, GreenSock, and Sass.
